## Project Overview
This project focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of **MapaKalamidad.ph**, a platform designed to assist in **Disaster Risk Reduction Management (DRRM)** during typhoons in the Philippines. By analyzing real-time information sharing, response coordination, and community resilience, we aim to understand the platform’s impact on disaster preparedness and recovery.

## Problem Statement
While the Philippines has made significant progress in **Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM)**, challenges remain in ensuring timely and effective responses during typhoons, particularly in real-time information sharing and community preparedness. Delayed responses and limited access to reliable data can leave affected areas more vulnerable. **MapaKalamidad.ph**, a crowd-sourced disaster information platform, has the potential to address these challenges by providing real-time data and enhancing coordination between responders and communities. This project aims to assess how effectively MapaKalamidad.ph supports disaster preparedness, improves response times, and strengthens community resilience during typhoons.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are to:
- **Evaluate** the role of MapaKalamidad.ph in improving disaster response times.
- **Analyze** the platform's influence on community preparedness during typhoons.
- **Examine** how well the platform integrates with **Local Government Unit (LGU)** strategies and whether it aids in better reporting of disaster incidents.

## Analytical Questions
1. How does MapaKalamidad.ph influence disaster response times?
2. How do users perceive the platform’s usefulness during typhoons?
3. What impact has it had on the number of unreported incidents?
4. How well is the platform integrated with LGU response strategies?
5. Does the platform help communities prepare better for disasters?
