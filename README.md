## Project Overview
This project focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of **MapaKalamidad.ph**, a platform designed to assist in **Disaster Risk Reduction Management (DRRM)** during typhoons in the Philippines. By analyzing real-time information sharing, response coordination, and community resilience, we aim to understand the platform’s impact on disaster preparedness and recovery.

## Problem Statement
While the Philippines has made significant progress in **Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM)**, challenges remain in ensuring timely and effective responses during typhoons, particularly in real-time information sharing and community preparedness. Delayed responses and limited access to reliable data can leave affected areas more vulnerable. **MapaKalamidad.ph**, a crowd-sourced disaster information platform, has the potential to address these challenges by providing real-time data and enhancing coordination between responders and communities. This project aims to assess how effectively MapaKalamidad.ph supports disaster preparedness, improves response times, and strengthens community resilience during typhoons.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are to:
- **Evaluate** the role of MapaKalamidad.ph in improving disaster response times.
- **Analyze** the platform's influence on community preparedness during typhoons.
- **Examine** how well the platform integrates with **Local Government Unit (LGU)** strategies and whether it aids in better reporting of disaster incidents.

## Scope and Limitations

The analysis focuses on **archival reports** of data collected during the months of **January and February**, specifically in typhoon-affected regions where **MapaKalamidad.ph** was utilized. The evaluation includes responses from LGUs, user feedback, and disaster outcomes within this time frame.

However, certain limitations may affect the analysis:
- **Time Frame**: The analysis is restricted to the months of **January–February**, which may not provide a comprehensive view of the platform's effectiveness during other typhoon seasons.
- **Data Availability**: There may be limitations in the availability and consistency of data from LGUs and other local sources, which could impact the overall findings.

## Analytical Questions

1. **What are the trends in disaster reports** during the specified time period (January–February) in regions affected by typhoons?
2. **How frequently are incidents reported** on MapaKalamidad.ph during typhoons, and what types of incidents are most commonly reported?
3. **What is the geographical distribution** of reports in the available data, and which regions are most impacted by typhoons based on the API data?
4. **What are the patterns in response times** as indicated by the data in the system?
5. **How does the number of reports change over time** during the disaster period covered by the dataset?
